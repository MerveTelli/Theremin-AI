# Some Rules for Dataset Creation


    1. Before Resizing, Change names. 
        ex. bzeabxyz (bze init of my name, ab is number of my working season, xyz is number of photos that in the folder)
    
    2. Before Labeling, always resize the images

    3. After Resizing, Don't forget to delete your raw images

    4. After Resizing, Don't Forget to Move your Resized images to a different folder

    5. Image names MUST BE UNIQUE, We don't want to have confliction in future when we have a dataset pool

    6. Labels files must be .json 

    7. Label file names must be same with the image file names

    8. Before train our model, json to intelligible conversion is a MUST
